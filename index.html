   <p class="intro">Do you ever sit on the B line and think about how many stops there are? What if you could get rid of a few? How much faster could you go? Where could you grab a taco at each stop? Check out some information on various B Line stops to understand how it’s utilized and supported.</p>

                  name of each stop and information about it. Learn about points of interest near each stop, how much time you'd save if you got rid of a stop, and where to grab a taco near each stop! Select between time-saving mode or taco mode to see relevant information on each stop depending on what mode you choose.</p>
